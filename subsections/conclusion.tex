In this paper, we introduce a classification technique for classifying fruits and vegetables on a conveyor. While DNNs are the established industry standard for an application like this, we propose a different method that is less complex computationally to provide a better runtime while maintaining a good accuracy. The proposed method is comprised of three stages, namely image segmentation, feature extraction and classification. For each image, two masked images are obtained by applying two segmentation masks -- one for lighter vegetables and one for darker vegetables. The two images are then used for feature extraction. We perform max-pooling to keep the colour data and use LBP and HOG to get feature descriptors. All of this is then used by a bagged decision tree classifier (with 5 trees) to output the class prediction.

The proposed classifier demonstrates the potential to be a viable alternative to established DNNs such as Inception due to its high performance and accuracy on small datasets. This could prove to be beneficial to use in the food industry for fast classifications for sorting and other applications.
